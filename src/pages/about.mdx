# About The hOSe Project

Hi!

The hOSe Project has been a concept for (at time of writing) more than 2 years! It started in 2023, when I was realizing that my grandparents were starting to need more and more help with using their computers for everyday tasks. I wanted to try and make a difference, so during my opportunity with Personal Project, I started my plan to build an operating system centered around the needs of the elderly. Although this website will only host the proposed features, and roadmap, I will still attempt to build a working system, and publish it here, once I am completed!
