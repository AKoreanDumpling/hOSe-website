Below are the planned features that will be integrated into the final hOSe.

## "One Focus" Interface
hOSe will have a specially designed "One Focus" user interface. The simple point and click interface is designed to help the user focus on just one task at a time, without confusing popups or distractions. It will be designed with large icons and buttons, as well as easy to read text, which has already been well documented to help elderly people feel more comfortable with understanding how to interact with their computer. It has also been shown to improve willingness to learn, according to _(Wu et al.)_.

## Non-overwhelming Settings Menus
hOSe aims to be self-explanatory, and easily understood. The settings menu should be user-friendly, and not intimidating. As people age, their ability to process larger amounts of information, especially new or foriegn, decreases, according to _(Frontiers in Human Neuroscience et al.)_, and the speed at which elderly people can think decreases also. As a result, the easier it is to glance at a menu and understand what is being displayed, the more success there will be trying to encourage customization, and configuration of the computer.

## Accesibility Options
hOSe, being built on the stable Linux Mint operating system, will have almost all available accesibility tools currently available on the market. These options, such as display magnification, text size adjustment, and  can be configured and customized during first time setup, or anytime in the settings app.
