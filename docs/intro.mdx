# What is The hOSe Project?

The hOSe Project, or The Humane Operating System for the Elderly, is an open-source project designed to help elderly people use their computer in a simple, intuitive, and fulfilling way. As an operating system, it replaces whatever is currently running on your computer, and will control the entire user experience.

:::note
Please note that hOSe **is not an app**. It is designed to be a replacement for whatever is currently running your computer (ex. Windows, MacOS).
